# Edit Modal Diagnosis Steps

## What to do:
1. Open user-management.html in your browser
2. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
3. Go to the **Console** tab
4. Click the **Edit** button (pencil icon) on any user row
5. Copy and paste **ALL** console output in your response

## What we're looking for:
- Does "editUserAccount called" appear?
- Does "Fetching user details" appear?
- Is there a Supabase error?
- Do form elements exist?
- Does "Opening modal" appear?
- Does "Modal shown event fired" appear?

This will help identify exactly where the issue is.
