KEY FIELD CLARIFICATIONS
=====================================

✓ CONFIRMED: patient_no and facility_id_code are DIFFERENT
- patient_no (mapped to: pid) = Unique patient identifier (e.g., PAT0001, PAT1233)
- facility_id_code = Facility identifier code (e.g., FAC001, FAC002)
- fid = Facility foreign key (numeric ID: 1, 2, 3, 4)

QUESTIONS TO CLARIFY
=====================================

1. Is "patient_no" the same as "facility_id_code"?
   - Sample shows: facility_id_code = 'FAC001'
   - But we use patient_no = 'PAT0001' in forms
   
2. Should we add these to the form?
   - email
   - facility_id_code / patient_no
   - health_worker_name
   - health_worker_role
   - art_start_date
   - patient_registration_date
   - appointment_time
   - next_appointment
   - clinical_note (vs notes)
   - facility contact info
